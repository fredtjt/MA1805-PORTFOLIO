This is a soundboard media sketch, press mouse1 to change the heavies face, and to play a new sound!

In this prompt I was tasked of creating original and unique sprites for my sketch. 

I decided I would follow the theme of my Final Project and create sprites based on my theme of html games that you could find on sites such as "the useless web." 

I created three different characters with 3 different emotions, and I created a background aswell, which holds numerous logos throughout the inspiration game "Team Fortress 2,"

Through this weeks prompt I learned how to preload media and use variables to declare them, I made sure to keep count of the height and width of the sprites by creating canvas' which were the appropriate pixel size.

have fun!
