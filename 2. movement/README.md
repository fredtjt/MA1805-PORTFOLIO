This is a drawing sketch, you right click to refresh the canvas, and to choose a new random colour to draw on. By moving the position of the cursor, you are able to draw a line of differently shaped squares.

Upon looking at week 3 and reading about variables and debugging, I soon got the grasp on the basics of how to read code and how to tie off a sketch. I decided for my random function art, I would choose to have a series of squares which hold a random colour upon refreshing a website, however I felt that I could do better than that, and after researching about myPad and mySize I was able to change the shapes to be in a differing square pattern.

I then attempted to create text in the middle of the screen however it was difficult to have a random colour on the text Aswell. The next Day after watching some p5.js tutorials on YouTube I tried to learn more about the random function and variables. I decided to start afresh and I then decided to firstly get variables down, so I sketched a simple erasing script, with a yellow background, where if you left clicked, the drawing would be repainted and the background colour would be randomised. 

By setting the R G and B as random in the draw function I was able to change the background further down the script. I was then able to write my name and carry on with the random function.
