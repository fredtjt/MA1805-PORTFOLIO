HAPPY HALLOWEEEEEN

This is an example of my work with Arrays, loops and Conditionals, 

This is a simple art sketch, with a pumpkin in the middle, and falling circles to create a cool waterfall effect, (themed accordingly to the date.)

This week we looked into showcasing Arrays which are essentially boiled down to being a list of data, I went through the tasks for the week, and gained a deeper understanding of the way they use containers to store lots of variables.
I decided I would follow suit from the “Falling Object,” exercise from the notion page, by coding a similar sketch that would have shapes falling from the sky.  I decided I would (sticking with the topic of later October) code a Halloween based art piece.
In the original sketch, they were white rectangles, and few of them, however I decided to change the shapes to orange circles, and enlarged them to make a cool wave pattern, I also added more shapes along the X axis to fill in any gaps in the canvas.
The original “Falling Objects,” sketch also taught me the use of loops and conditionals, for example using loops to create an even flow of shapes falling downwards when running the live server. I also learnt the use of conditionals, using them to reset the circles when they had fallen through the screen.
To make the script a little more themed, I used the draw function to create a simple pumpkin at centre screen, with the writing “Happy Halloween,” written in the top left of the canvas.
